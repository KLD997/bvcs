BVCS
A suckless version control system

Features
Very very small:
The bvcs binary is only 2KB in size.

It's not even a binary
Bvcs is purely written in friendly shell script. You can modify it yourself too and don't have to struggle so much!

Has only commands you need
Bvcs comes with just 5 commands because let's face it -- we only use commit and checkout and log.

Extremely high speed:
You can checkout to any commit in a matter of milliseconds. Why did we ever need those huge linked lists and diffs? You can go anywhere you want instantly because what you did is always safe with bvcs.

No more tiring commit messages (and hashes):
Bvcs doesn't ask you to write those long descriptive commit messages, you lose half of your strength writing those. And then the misery of finding all those hashes among your log. Bvcs asks you to set the id of commit yourself... JUST THE ID.
